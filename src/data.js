    about: "Hello my name is Gerardo Keys. I have over 5 years of IT support experience working at some of the biggest tech companies in the world. I have become very experienced working in high performing and stressful environments, that have challenged and tested me in many different ways. I bring a diverse skillset of technical experience and amazing customer service. I am currently looking for new opportunities and challenges and to continue to grow with a great team. I have experience working in every aspect of IT including Google suite administration, Active Directory administration, executive support, onboarding, AV / conference room support, networking and security support, jira ticketing system, new engineering setups. On my own I have studied programming, specifically web application development using tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SASS, BEM, React, Node, and SQL. I have become proficient and have a GitHub account with about 20 or so projects. Doing this has given me a deeper understanding of programming which I can bring to any job that needs it."
